# NAME

Task::ModernPerlBook::4e - Install CPAN modules for the Modern Perl book, 4e

# SYNOPSIS

    use Task::ModernPerlBook::4e;

# DESCRIPTION

Task::ModernPerlBook::4e is a bundle of useful CPAN modules mentioned in the
first edition of the Modern Perl book
([http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern\_perl/](http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl/)). Installing this will
install all of them for you.

Note that `perl5i` is \_not\_ included, because it's experimental and difficult
to install and `UNIVERSAL::ref` is excluded, because it currently does not build after Perl 5.25.1.

For the latest edition of the book, see [http://modernperlbooks.com/](http://modernperlbooks.com/).
